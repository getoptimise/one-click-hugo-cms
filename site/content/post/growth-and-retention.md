Mini Case Study

> After launching a reminders feature for a mobile app, the team looked at their data and noticed only 1% of their users took advantage of reminders. Further investigation showed that those 1% had a retention rate 3 times as high as the rest of their users. 
>
>
>
> They looked at their settings page and realised reminders were deeply buried. Based on the hypothesis that this was the reason for low adoption, they experimented with increasing the feature’s discoverability, by prompting new users to create reminders. 
>
>
>
> Through testing they found 40% of users who saw the new prompt then set a reminder with the same three times retention rate! Continual delving into soft and hard data was critical in helping to arrive at the right decision.
